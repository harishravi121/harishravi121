A physics olympiad question from HBCSE : 
Astronauts have found that the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from the surface of the
Moon is 1.9
◦
. We assume that:
• the observer is standing on the equator of the Earth.
• the Moon is in the equatorial plane.
• the Moon’s orbit is circular.
(a) (10 marks) Find the time it takes for the Moon to completely rise above the Earth’s
horizon.
(b) (3 marks) Briefly state why the three assumptions above are relevant to the solution.
(c) (2 marks) How much time would it take for the Earth to completely rise above Moon’s
horizon?

From gate 2023
Consider a tiny current loop driven by a sinusoidal alternating current. If the surface integral of time averaged Poynting vector is constant then the magnitude of the time averaged magnetic field intensity at an arbitrary r is \prop to 1/r^n where n=?
