A physics olympiad question from HBCSE : 
Astronauts have found that the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from the surface of the
Moon is 1.9
◦
. We assume that:
• the observer is standing on the equator of the Earth.
• the Moon is in the equatorial plane.
• the Moon’s orbit is circular.
(a) (10 marks) Find the time it takes for the Moon to completely rise above the Earth’s
horizon.
(b) (3 marks) Briefly state why the three assumptions above are relevant to the solution.
(c) (2 marks) How much time would it take for the Earth to completely rise above Moon’s
horizon?
