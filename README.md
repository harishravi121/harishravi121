## Hi there üëã

Hope to do lots of programming in various languages! I have put my github link on facebook and have to live with uncertainity always from bad people without following. Same with all social media and other links of FB..

A physics olympiad question from HBCSE : 
Astronauts have found that the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from the surface of the
Moon is 1.9
‚ó¶
. We assume that:
‚Ä¢ the observer is standing on the equator of the Earth.
‚Ä¢ the Moon is in the equatorial plane.
‚Ä¢ the Moon‚Äôs orbit is circular.
(a) (10 marks) Find the time it takes for the Moon to completely rise above the Earth‚Äôs
horizon.
(b) (3 marks) Briefly state why the three assumptions above are relevant to the solution.
(c) (2 marks) How much time would it take for the Earth to completely rise above Moon‚Äôs
horizon?

From gate 2023
Consider a tiny current loop driven by a sinusoidal alternating current. If the surface integral of time averaged Poynting vector is constant then the magnitude of the time averaged magnetic field intensity at an arbitrary r is \prop to 1/r^n where n=?

(If the variable takes values 0,1,2...n with frequency prop to
binomial coefff nC0..ncn, the variance of distribution is?) (*What is the length of tangent from 3,4 to parabola y^2-3y+4x=0 *) 2 math olympiad problems

Wishing there were  anaglyph games and phones with 2 camera software to take videos and photos.. (maybe people generate packages in teams of 100 etc by 2028)
